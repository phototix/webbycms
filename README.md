# webbycms - PHP Framework before you start

This is a very basic of WebbyCMS front-end PHP Framework.
Its works fine for all others front-end framework such as #Bootstraps, Foundation, and etc.

Clone/Download from the Github and start develop your PHP project.

#Master
This master copy only contains the PHP framework.
I've plan to remove the Foundations & Bootstrap branch and make it to a new GIT.

WebbyCMS is a standalone framework that capable to implement for any PHP project. WebbyCMS breaks to two parts. Front-end and Back-end.
Front-end framework temporary called WebbyFrame(c). Back-end framework is currently close sourced. Still in consideration for open sources. Will try to provide a full documentation when I have the time.
